## About

Add the BOM to text files encoded with UTF-8 without BOM.

***NOTE***: if you didn't set "withBom.includeFolders" property, this addon does nothing.

```json
"withBom.includeFolders": [
    "/path/to/your/project/src", // absolute
    "./or/relative" // or relative to workspace path
]
```
